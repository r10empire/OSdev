**Cross Compiler:**
A cross compiler is a type of compiler that generates executable code for a platform different from the one on which the compiler is running. This means it can compile code on one operating system or architecture to be run on another. Cross compilers are essential for developing software for embedded systems, where the target hardware is different from the development environment. For example, you might use a cross compiler to develop software on a Windows machine that will run on an ARM-based microcontroller.
